# xLoader
xLoader is an utility to program or flash HEX file onto ATmega328 and other AVR Microcontrollers. We simply need to download and extract files in the folder. Then click on XLoader.exe <b>Note:</b> Create desktop shortcut for quick access

# How to Use
The following steps will help us use XLoader to upload HEX file on ATmega328 (Arduino Uno).

1. Download [xLoader.zip](https://github.com/chayanforyou/xLoader/releases/latest) file
2. Unzip the `xLoader.zip`
3. Insert __USB to TTL__ into an available USB port
4. Execute `xLoader.exe`
5. Browse the .hex File from AVR Project/Atmeal Studio Project
6. Select the device E.g. In case of Arduino Uno, it's ATmega328
7. Select COM Port. If no COM port is available, install proper USB driver
8. Select right baud rate in case of Arduino Uno it's 115200
9. Finally hit `Upload` Button
